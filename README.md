##### t01

This is working code of the released version of sled 0.24.1 on may 12, 2019.
You will note if you compare the size of the db from this code versus
the the db of code in t02 (the master branch); that the db size has
been drastically reduced from 8M to 363 bytes and there is no longer
a snap file.  To better understand the changes made dive into the source
code and elucidate later.

##### t02

Latest and greatest code from the master branch.  All examples from
here will use the master branch.
